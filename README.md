# Viz-iT Frontend

Flutter mobile application for a Visual Search Engine. The main concept of this visual search engine project is to use
an image as
a search term. First segment that image into one or more objects, recognise those objects and then use the object
classification to get the object class. Then, use that object class as the search term query. The motivation for a
visual search engine is to provide the end-user vetted, trusted, and valuable content to their searchers based on the
given image as their search term query. This project will offer many applications such as: identifying objects within a
given image that users didn't know about, learning new objects and helping users find information on the internet in
terms of the image being the search query.
